## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
1. **Reliability**: System runs for 30 consecutive days without manual intervention
2. **Performance**: Web interface loads under 2 seconds on standard broadband
3. **Data Integrity**: All generated ideas stored successfully with complete metadata
4. **Error Handling**: Cron job failures are logged and recoverable
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Full functionality on devices with 320px+ width

### Functional Success Metrics
1. **Idea Quality**: Each generated idea includes factual supporting data
2. **User Experience**: Users can find and explore ideas within 3 clicks
3. **Filtering Efficiency**: Search results appear within 500ms
4. **Content Completeness**: Every idea includes industry tags and complexity rating
5. **Interface Usability**: Mobile interface maintains desktop functionality

### Business Value Metrics
1. **Consistency**: New idea generated every weekday without gaps
2. **Variety**: Ideas span multiple industries and target markets
3. **Actionability**: Each idea includes enough detail for initial feasibility assessment
4. **Accessibility**: System usable by non-technical entrepreneurs
5. **Scalability**: Codebase structured for easy feature additions

## Project Boundaries

### What We Will Build
- Complete automated idea generation system
- Functional web interface with core features
- Reliable cron job automation
- Basic error handling and logging
- Development environment setup

### What We Won't Build (Yet)
- Production-ready deployment
- User management system
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Integration with external business tools
- Complex workflow management

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Claude CLI Integration**: Test thoroughly with various prompt scenarios
- **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance as dataset grows
- **Cron Job Reliability**: Implement robust error handling and logging

### Scope Risks  
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to core prototype features
- **Over-Engineering**: Focus on functional prototype, not production system
- **Time Management**: Prioritize working system over perfect implementation

## Success Definition
